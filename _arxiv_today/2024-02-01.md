1. 9.1 [A Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Uniform PAC Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17780)
* Authors: Toshinori Kitamura, Tadashi Kozuno, Masahiro Kato, Yuki Ichihara, Soichiro Nishimori, Akiyoshi Sannai, Sho Sonoda, Wataru Kumagai, Yutaka Matsuo
* Reason: This paper introduces a policy gradient primal-dual algorithm with uniform probably approximately correct (Uniform-PAC) guarantees for constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), offering theoretical and empirical enhancements to previous algorithms without such guarantees.

2. 9.0 [Step-size Optimization for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17401)
* Authors: Thomas Degris, Khurram Javed, Arsalan Sharifnassab, Yuxin Liu, Richard Sutton
* Reason: Co-authored by Richard Sutton, a prominent authority in the field of reinforcement learning, this paper presents improvements in learning algorithmsâ€™ step-size vectors, potentially influencing the optimization procedures in RL methods.

3. 8.9 [Agile But Safe: Learning Collision-Free High-Speed Legged Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17583)
* Authors: Tairan He, Chong Zhang, Wenli Xiao, Guanqi He, Changliu Liu, Guanya Shi
* Reason: Integrates advanced learning-based control with robotics, a critical RL application domain, and proposes a promising framework to address safety and agility in legged robot locomotion, presented with real-world experiments.

4. 8.6 [Game-Theoretic Unlearnable Example Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17523)
* Authors: Shuang Liu, Yihan Wang, Xiao-Shan Gao
* Reason: This paper proposes a novel attack method from a game-theoretic perspective in the context of unlearnable example attacks, intersecting RL with adversarial machine learning, which is a burgeoning area of research.

5. 8.5 [Graph Attention-based Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory Design and Resource Assignment in Multi-UAV Assisted Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17880)
* Authors: Zikai Feng, Di Wu, Mengxing Huang, Chau Yuen
* Reason: Tackles the dynamic and complex problem of trajectory design and resource management in UAV-assisted communication networks using a graph attention model, integrating ideas from multi-agent systems in the RL framework.
