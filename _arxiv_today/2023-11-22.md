1. 8.9 [Decentralised Q-Learning for Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes with a Satisfiability Criterion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12613)
* Authors: Keshav P. Keval, Vivek S. Borkar
* Reason: Proposed a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with potential applications and contribution to multi-agent systems.

2. 8.7 [Provable Representation with Efficient Planning for Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12244)
* Authors: Hongming Zhang, Tongzheng Ren, Chenjun Xiao, Dale Schuurmans, Bo Dai
* Reason: The methodology addresses a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (partially observable states), and is built upon a solid theoretical foundation with empirical demonstrations. Contributions from authors affiliated with recognizable institutions, and the inclusion of a well-known researcher in the field, Dale Schuurmans, suggest strong potential influence.

3. 8.7 [Differentiable Sampling of Categorical Distributions Using the CatLog-Derivative Trick](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12569)
* Authors: Lennert De Smet, Emanuele Sansone, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires
* Reason: Presents a significant improvement in the field of gradient estimation for discrete distributions, which could advance the efficiency of REINFORCE and related algorithms in reinforcement learning.

4. 8.5 [Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition: A taxonomy and framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12495)
* Authors: Florian Felten, El-Ghazali Talbi, Grégoire Danoy
* Reason: The paper proposes a taxonomy and framework in a niche but growing area of reinforcement learning, which could significantly influence further research. The potential publication in JAIR and the authoritative backgrounds of the authors contribute to the impact score.

5. 8.5 [Machine-Guided Discovery of a Real-World Rogue Wave Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12579)
* Authors: Dion Häfner, Johannes Gemmrich, Markus Jochum
* Reason: The paper showcases the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences, potentially guiding future research in reinforcement learning applications for scientific discovery.

6. 8.2 [Koopman Learning with Episodic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12615)
* Authors: William T. Redman, Dean Huang, Maria Fonoberova, Igor Mezić
* Reason: Integrates a key machine learning technique with a dynamical systems approach, potentially enhancing the learning capability of Koopman operator methods.

7. 8.1 [An efficient likelihood-free Bayesian inference method based on sequential neural posterior estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12530)
* Authors: Yifei Xiong, Xiliang Yang, Sanguo Zhang, Zhijian He
* Reason: The paper enhances an existing method in simulation-based models, key in certain reinforcement learning scenarios. The comprehensive methodological improvements backed by theoretical analysis and empirical evidence suggest a moderate level of prospective influence.

8. 8.0 [Improving Source-Free Target Adaptation with Vision Transformers Leveraging Domain Representation Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12589)
* Authors: Gauransh Sawhney, Daksh Dave, Adeel Ahmed, Jiechao Gao, Khalid Saleem
* Reason: Introduces an innovative method to enhance Vision Transformer performance in unsupervised domain adaptation, which can indirectly affect reinforcement learning practices in domain generalization.

9. 7.9 [Summary of the DISPLACE Challenge 2023 -- DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12564)
* Authors: Shikha Baghel, Shreyas Ramoji, Somil Jain, Pratik Roy Chowdhuri, Prachi Singh, Deepu Vijayasenan, Sriram Ganapathy
* Reason: Challenges and competitions can propel advancement by benchmarking state-of-the-art methods, but this paper is more of a summary report than a direct contribution to reinforcement learning methodology, leading to a slightly lower potential influence score.

10. 7.7 [Explainable Anomaly Detection using Masked Latent Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12550)
* Authors: Daesoo Lee, Sara Malacarne, Erlend Aune
* Reason: While the focus is on anomaly detection, the explainability aspect of the proposed method could have trickle-down effects on reinforcement learning, especially in improving the understanding of agent behaviors. Yet, its indirect relation to core RL diminishes its impact rating.
