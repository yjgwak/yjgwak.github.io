1. 9.5 [Feature Matching Data Synthesis for Non-IID Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04761)
* Authors: Zijian Li, Yuchang Sun, Jiawei Shao, Yuyi Mao, Jessie Hui Wang, Jun Zhang
* Reason: The authors present a new method for tackling the non-IID issue in Federated Learning by synthesizing data that matches class-relevant features. The novel FL framework, integrated with the proposed method, demonstrates advantage in accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational cost.

2. 9.3 [Intrinsic Motivation via Surprise Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04836)
* Authors: Hung Le, Kien Do, Dung Nguyen, Svetha Venkatesh
* Reason: The authors innovatively propose an original model for intrinsic rewards in reinforcement learning that promises more efficient exploring behaviors and boosts performance in sparse reward environments.

3. 9.0 [Tram-FL: Routing-based Model Training for Decentralized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04762)
* Authors: Kota Maejima, Takayuki Nishio, Asato Yamazaki, Yuko Hara-Azumi
* Reason: The paper presents a novel decentralized federated learning method, Tram-FL, that refines a global model by sequentially transferring it amongst nodes to improve performance and reduce communication costs.

4. 8.7 [When and How Does Known Class Help Discover Unknown Ones? Provable Understanding Through Spectral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05017)
* Authors: Yiyou Sun, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang, Yixuan Li
* Reason: The paper introduces a new analytical framework to understand when and how known classes can aid in the discovery of novel classes with a theoretically guaranteed approach.

5. 8.6 [Collaborative Learning From Distributed Data With Differentially Private Synthetic Twin Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04755)
* Authors: Lukas Prediger, Joonas Jälkö, Antti Honkela, Samuel Kaski
* Reason: The authors make headway in privacy-preserving collaborative learning methods by proposing a synthesizing data with differential privacy framework enabling learning from sensitive data without violating privacy constraints.
