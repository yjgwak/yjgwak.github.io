1. 8.9 [Sustainability of Data Center Digital Twins with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10786)
* Authors: Soumyendu Sarkar, Avisek Naug, Antonio Guillen, Ricardo Luna, Vineet Gundecha, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sajad Mousavi
* Reason: The paper covers the timely and significant challenge of reducing carbon footprints in data centers, which is a critical issue given the rise of computational demands. Also, it offers a novel multi-agent RL environment, which can potentially become a benchmark for future RL research in sustainable computing.

2. 8.7 [What Hides behind Unfairness? Exploring Dynamics Fairness in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10942)
* Authors: Zhihong Deng, Jing Jiang, Guodong Long, Chengqi Zhang
* Reason: Tackles the essential and emerging problem of fairness in RL with a causal approach. The novel concept of dynamics fairness introduced could become influential as it offers a new dimension to understand and mitigate unfairness in decision-making systems.

3. 8.5 [Group-Aware Coordination Graph for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10976)
* Authors: Wei Duan, Jie Lu, Junyu Xuan
* Reason: Addresses cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning by introducing a new information exchange graph that enhances performance. Its application potential in simulations, such as in StarCraft II, and its ablation study could provide significant insights for other researchers.

4. 8.3 [Sample Complexity of the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Reinforcement Learning Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10851)
* Authors: Amirreza Neshaei Moghaddam, Alex Olshevsky, Bahman Gharesifard
* Reason: Provides a new approach to a classical control problem which could have wider implications for both RL theory and control systems.

5. 8.1 [Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning Controller for Energy from Spread Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10991)
* Authors: Soumyendu Sarkar, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Alexander Shmakov, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Avisek Naug, Alexandre Pichard, Mathieu Cocho
* Reason: The paper can potentially influence the renewable energy sector by improving the efficiency of Wave Energy Converters using MARL, which is a crucial area for sustainable development and combating climate change.
