1. 9.1 [Compositional Conservatism: A Transductive Approach in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04682)
* Authors: Yeda Song, Dongwook Lee, Gunhee Kim
* Reason: Introduces a novel approach in offline RL, which is a critical domain in RL research. The authors' previous work and the acceptance at ICLR 2024 increases the credibility of the paper.

2. 8.8 [Skill Transfer and Discovery for Sim-to-Real Learning: A Representation-Based Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05051)
* Authors: Haitong Ma, Zhaolin Ren, Bo Dai, Na Li
* Reason: Addresses the pivotal sim-to-real transfer issue in RL for robotics, which is a rapidly advancing field. The project page and strong empirical results support the potential influence of this work.

3. 8.6 [Percentile Criterion Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05055)
* Authors: Elita A. Lobo, Cyrus Cousins, Yair Zick, Marek Petrik
* Reason: Offers a novel algorithmic solution to a well-known problem in RL with a strong theoretical and practical significance, which is also validated by the acceptance at Neurips 2023.

4. 8.4 [SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05249)
* Authors: Yusuf Umut Ciftci, Zeyuan Feng, Somil Bansal
* Reason: Presents a new perspective on behavior cloning in safety-critical applications, which is essential both for theoretical and practical considerations in RL.

5. 8.2 [Humanoid-Gym: Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Robot with Zero-Shot Sim2Real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05695)
* Authors: Xinyang Gu, Yen-Jen Wang, Jianyu Chen
* Reason: Introducing a framework for RL on humanoid robots, coupled with the challenge of zero-shot sim-to-real transfer which is a trending topic in RL for robotics.
